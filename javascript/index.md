Ghost provides promise-based JavaScript client libraries, which handle the details of authentication, request and response formats and makes working with each API as easy as possible. Each API has its own client library.

## Content API Client Library

The [Content API client library](/api/javascript/content/) is a tiny tool, available for both the browser and Node.js.

The Content API is designed for any situation in which you want to fetch data from your Ghost install and supports use cases from creating a latest posts widget on your main site to generating a fully static Gatsby site.

## Admin API Client Library

The [Admin API client library](/api/javascript/admin/) is designed for integrations that use private API keys, and is for Node.js only.

The Admin API supports publishing workflows where you want to integrate Ghost with other tools, such as publishing content from a desktop editor, sharing content to social media on publish, or syncing data to and from email campaign software.

## JavaScript SDK

As well as individual client libraries, we have an ever-growing [JavaScript SDK](/api/javascript/sdk/) with a suite of tools that help you work with your data before and after working with the API.
